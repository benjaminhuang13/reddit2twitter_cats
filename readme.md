# 2023 Update: Twitter shut off it's Free API. This twitter project is now deprecated.

# Reddit 2 Twitter Bot
This app takes posts from the Sub-Reddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Catswithjobs/ and re-post it onto Twitter https://twitter.com/employedcats. 
In order to accomplish this, I had to apply for a Reddit developer account: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps

## Credentials Needed`
The credentials are stored in an environment file that is included in this repo. The format of the .env file:
    `CONSUMER_KEY=""`
    `CONSUMER_SECRET=""`
    `ACCESS_TOKEN=""`
    `ACCESS_SECRET=""`
    `BEARER_TOKEN=""`

    `REDDIT_API_SECRET=""`
    `REDDIT_PERSONAL_USE_SCRIPT=""`
    `REDDIT_USERNAME=""`
    `REDDIT_PW=""`

To gain proper Twitter API access, I had to request for a developer account: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api. I then had to request for Essential level access. More info about access levels can be found here: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api
