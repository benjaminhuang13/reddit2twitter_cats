This app takes the first post from the subreddit https://www.reddit.com/r/Catswithjobs/ and post it on twitter.
I had to get a developer account for Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps
The credentials are stored in an environment file that is included in this repo. The format of the .env file:
    CONSUMER_KEY=""
    CONSUMER_SECRET=""
    ACCESS_TOKEN=""
    ACCESS_SECRET=""
    BEARER_TOKEN=""

    REDDIT_API_SECRET=""
    REDDIT_PERSONAL_USE_SCRIPT=""
    REDDIT_USERNAME=""
    REDDIT_PW=""

To gain proper Twitter API access, I had to request for a developer account: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api
I than had to request for Essential level access. More info about access levels: https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api
